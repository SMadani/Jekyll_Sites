**Speakers**:

- [Lindsey Myers](https://www.york.ac.uk/library/info-for/researchers/support) – Research Support Librarian

**Abstract**:

Do you produce programs? Results from computer-based experiments? Experimental results from studies using humans? ALL of this is data that the university is concerned about.

All researchers have a responsibility to properly manage the data they create/collect during the course of their research.

**The management of research data is sufficiently important that many research funders, and the University, have requirements for how it is managed.**

This generic talk will provide an introduction to research data management, covering best practice for the successful organisation, storage, documentation and archiving/sharing of research data. Areas covered include:

- what is research data management

- University requirements for research data management and funder policies

- the day-to-day management of data

- preserving/sharing research data at the end of a project

- data management planning


**Chair**: [Savan Vachhani](http://savan.in/)
