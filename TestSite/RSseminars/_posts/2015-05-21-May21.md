Not sure what to do after you finish your PhD/EngD? Let our talks this month help you decide. Our speakers this month are both recent York PhD graduates, Sam Devlin was in the AI Group and Jason Reich in PLASMA. Following their PhDs, Jason chose to go into industry, working as a Lead Developer for IBM, while Sam has taken the academic route and works on the NEMOG (games) project. They will be talking about what led to their decision and what it’s like in their current jobs.
