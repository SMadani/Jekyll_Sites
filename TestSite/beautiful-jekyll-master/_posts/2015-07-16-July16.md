**Abstract**:

- **Part I: _“Xtext: A language workbench that any PhD student should know.”_ (Adolfo Sanchez-Barbudo Herrera)**
   
    A language is something that we, as computer scientists use not only to communicate with our colleagues, but also with computers. From a very domain specific tool to get some experiment results, to a more general programming language to build software, languages are an instrument that researchers, especially in computer science, have to deal with everyday. In some areas of research we might even find the need to create a new language, rather than just using the existing ones.
 
    In this RS seminar an specific language workbench called Xtext will be introduced with the goal of leveraging the barrier to students that have the need to create *textual* languages as well as a whole high quality IDE (editors, views, etc.) to support the manipulation of their language instances.
 

  
- **Part II: _“From infobesity to elegant satisficiency: can systems cure bad information behaviour?”_ (Jo Pugh)**
   
    As the ability to rapidly assimilate large amounts of content becomes ever more prized, users who struggle with or appear to avoid data are claimed to be suffering from overload, anxiety and other 'pathologies of information'. We will discuss the information behaviours of users of online archival systems observed in a recent study and consider the implications for future system design.
