**Abstract**:

Version Control Systems (or VCSs) are used nowadays not only to track versions of artefacts (as the name suggests) but to enable collaboration. In this talk we will try to motivate the benefits of using a VCS and give a brief introduction to the two main approaches of version control systems, the decentralised and the centralised. One example of each will be presented to highlight the differences between them and the advantages/disadvantages of each. 

We will then give a short demo of one of the currently most widely used VCSs, called Git. We will demonstrate basic functionality, like versioning files, aspects of collaboration, like sharing a project and working on it, and finally some more complicated bits related to branching, merging, rebasing and resolution of conflicts.
