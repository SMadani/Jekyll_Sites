**Speakers**:

- [Professor Richard Paige](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~paige/)

- [Dr. James R. Williams](http://www.jamesrobertwilliams.co.uk/index.php)

- [Dr. Ian Gray](http://iangray.me.uk/)


**Abstract**:

This seminar aims to provide insight on what is a PhD viva, and what PhD students are expected to do during the final PhD milestone. In particular, this seminar will cover the period between PhD thesis submission and the day of the viva, and discuss several topics, including:

- finding the right external examiners

- best practises for preparing for your viva

- how PhD studens can make the most of their preparation

- what happens after the viva

- In this regard, the seminar will present both the internal/external examiner’s perspective and the PhD student’s perspective.



Prof. Richard Paige will present the examiner’s perspective and give advice on the topic, answering questions like:

- are there any typical viva questions?

- have you examined any remarkable or “lousy” vivas – what went well (or wrong)?

- How would you advise students to prepare?


Dr. James R. Williams and Dr. Ian Gray, relatively recent PhD graduates, will provide useful information about their experience, and answer questions including:

- how did they prepare for their viva?

- what issues did they have to deal with during the oral examination?

- what would they do differently?



**Chair**: Simos Gerasimou
