**Speaker**:
Dr. Paul Cairns (HCI group CS@UoY) 

**Abstract**:
Many PhD students do not take seriously not writing their thesis which results in them writing theses that reveal the essence of their ideas with clarity and concision. This talk aims to give five great ways to not write a thesis based on my experience of supervising, assessing and examining doctorates over the last 15 years. At the end of the talk, you should be well equipped to write a thesis guaranteed to annoy your examiners.
