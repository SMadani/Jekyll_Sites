**Speakers**:

- [Pedro Ribeiro](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~pfr)

- [Alan Millard](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/millard)


**Abstract**:

Being a research student means to know the importance of a good procrastination session. We cannot start doing a challenging task (e.g., conducting a new experiment or writing a research paper) without first spending half an hour browsing the internet or looking at our Twitter/Facebook feed.

Taking this into consideration, this seminar considers procrastination, that is, the temptation to put off tasks that cause stress in favour of doing something that is more enjoyable or that we are more comfortable doing.

Our speakers will talk about their experience in dealing with procrastination to carry out both academic and non-academic tasks and suggest effective ways, techniques and tools to eliminate procrastination.

This seminar aims to provide insight on the following topics:

- Understanding the reasons why we procrastinate

- Recognising when we procrastinate

- Enhancing confidence and completing successfully major tasks

- Adopting anti-procrastination strategies
