**Speaker**:

- [Dr Kirsty Holley](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/?group=Administrative%20Staff&username=holley) â€“ Research Studies Administrator

**Abstract**
As we all know, doing a PhD can be hard. It's challenging doing research, with constant deadlines, pressure to publish, the loneliness of being the only person working on your topic, homesickness, being away from friends and family.

But how can you cope with these pressures and stresses? How do you know when these become something more concerning? Who can you talk to when life and work feel really hard? What are your options? And what can the department do to help you?

Kirsty Holley, is the Research Student Administrator in CS. She also completed her PhD at the University of York, and experienced these very issues. Kirsty will talk about her experiences, before discussing where you can get help in the department and University. She would also be keen to hear what else the department could do to help, all suggestions are welcome!
